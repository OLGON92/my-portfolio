  <p>Here is a sample of some of the <em>projects</em> I have been working on:</p>

  <h2 class="center"><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/1st-webpage-practice"> 1st-webpage-practice</a></h2>

  <div class="box1">
    <p>As the title implies this was my <span class="highlight">first</span> project. It was one many projects that would teach me how to understand html. There are two html pages: one is mock-up of a website, and the second is a list of some of my favorite things; mostly has photos of friends and family. Also included is a README.md file, a css file with a stylesheet, and an img file.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="center"><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/CupOfCakes">
    CupOfCakes</a></h3>

  <div class="box1">
    <p>This was my <span class="highlight">second</span> project. I worked on this project with Amiya; one of the people in my dev team. I learned a lot from her and this project. I learned more about divs, spans, and classes. The languages used in this project were md, html, and css.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h4 class="center"><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/pet-website-blog">
    pet-website-blog</a></h4>

  <div class="box1">
    <p>This is a blog about one of my cats. This was more of a side/further exploration project that incorporates most of the things I have been learning in my classes at <span class="highlight">epicodus</span>. It uses the same languages that can be found on my previous projects; and they are: md, html, and css. It is still a work in progress as I continue to play with different styles.</p>
  </div>

  <p> Here are the three languages I have learned so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Markdown</li>
  </ul>
