  <p>Here is a sample of some of the <em>projects</em> I have been working on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div class="box">
      <a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/1st-webpage-practice">
      1st-webpage-practice</a>
        <p>As the title implies this was my <span class="highlight">first</span> project. It was one many projects that would teach me how to understand html. There are two html pages: one is mock-up of a website, and the second is a list of some of my favorite things; mostly has photos of friends and family.</p>
      </div>
      </a>
    </li>

      <div class="box">

      CupOfCakes</a>
        <p>some text for now</p>
      </div>
