<p>Hello, my name is Oscar Gonzalez. I am just starting out on my programming journey. I grew up in Los Angeles,California, and I have been living in Portland for nearly seven years. I graduated from Pasadena City College in May 2015 with two degrees: an A.A. in Humanities, and an A.A. in Italian. I have worked a variety of jobs that have helped me develop my social skills, problem-solving skills, and leadership skills. At the moment I am taking a programming class at Epicodus in order to better understand programming as I have always had an interest in programming. I look forward to learning as much as I can, and eventually getting a job in the tech industry.</p>
